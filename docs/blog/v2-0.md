## Changes

1. snatcher

A snatcher, like fetch, carries data between pages.

However, it does not use http, such as fetch, but receives data directly from the file that corresponds to the page.

::: code-group

```ts [pages/index.ts]
import { snatcher } from 'prext';

export async function get(req, res) {
  const snatch = snatcher(req, res);
  const { body } = await snatch('/user');

  res.send(`users: ${body}`);
}
```

```ts [pages/users.ts]
export function get(req, res) {
  res.json({ cat: '🐱' });
}
```

2. public directory

Before, you had to set up a public directory with an external library, such as serve.. But you don't have to do that anymore!

::: code-group

```ts [prext.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
  public: '/public/',
});
```
