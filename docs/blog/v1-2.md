# v1.2

[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/do4ng/prext/blob/main/packages/prext/CHANGELOG.md#120-2023-04-04)

There are no new features in v1.2. But there's been a very important change.

We changed sard.js, which was the core server of prext, to osik.

There are advantages below:

---

1. lighter âš¡
2. delete unused features (code cleared!) ðŸŽ 
3. osik supports async by default. ðŸ‘‹

---

## Migration from 1.1

Plugin routing is no longer supported.

Use @osik/router middleware to use the routing feature.

```ts
import { Router } from '@osik/router';

const router = new Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.body = 'Hello World';
});

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    {
      name: 'router',
      server(app) {
        app.use(router.routes());
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
