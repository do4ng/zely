# What is Prext

🛰️ Prext is a backend framework for Node.js.

## Features

- **🚧 File-based routing.** Prext.js creates routes automatically with filenames.
- **🚀 Server Reload.** You don't have to restart server to apply changes.
- **✅ Typescript Supported.**
- **⚡ Lightning fast.** Prext uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) as javascript loader.

## Introduction

Prext.js (previous + next) is a node.js backend framework inspired by [next](https://nextjs.org/). This project aims to be the lightest Nodejs backend framework.

Prext is running on [osik](https://npmjs.com/package/osik) which was made for speed and weight. It also uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to reduce compile time.

## Why you made it?

Express or Node HTTP module is a awesome backend package, but it is so bothering to set routes.

To solve this problem I created this package.
